                    <div class="caption" style="width:55%"><i>All images are official Nasa pictures of Earth, as released through the mainstream media outlets and major news agencies of the world. Questions: How big is America? What colour are the oceans, and the land? Why is there never any real video of the Earth spinning, only stills? Why are the images so varied? Do you really believe this is where you live? Do you actually trust Nasa?</i></div>
