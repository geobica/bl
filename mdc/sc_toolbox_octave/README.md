# sc_toolbox_octave

Schwarz-Christoffel Toolbox for conformal mapping in MATLAB, which is copyright by Toby Driscoll 2003, and ported to Octave 5.0 by Joseph Malkoun in 2018.

The SC Toolbox contains numerical routines and graphical interfaces to work with Schwarz-Christoffel conformal maps--those to regions bounded by polgons in the complex plane. Many map variations are present.

For more details on the maps, see Schwarz Christoffel Mapping, by Driscoll and Trefethen. For a user's guide, visit http://www.math.udel.edu/~driscoll/SC.

Kindly note that while I (J.M.) did my best to port some of the basic commands to Octave 5.0, the gui part (invoked by scgui), is still unfortunately buggy.

There is NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER that the library works as claimed, and the developers (in particular Toby Driscoll, who holds the copyright, and Joseph Malkoun, who ported the library to Octave 5.0)
shall not be held responsible for any malfunctioning of any part of this Software.

I hope some people will find it useful though!
